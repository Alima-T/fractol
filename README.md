FRACT_OL -  one of the projects at 42 that brings together mathematics and graphics.

This project requires a mix of creativity and technical skills.
The goal is to develop a fractal renderer that generates a zoomable image with a repeating, infinite pattern. 

Two famous fractals explored in this project are the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set.
1. The Mandelbrot set is known for its stunning, self-similar shapes that reveal new details at every zoom level. 
2. The Julia set is a fractal with unique and complex patterns, each displaying infinite detail.

In this project I used the MLX42 library, which I cloned and installed from this repository:
